    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baklava is a traditional pastry known for its sweet, rich flavor and flaky texture. It consists of phyllo (or filo) dough, nuts, spices, and a sugary syrup.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Phyllo dough</li>
        <li>Nuts</li>
        <li>Butter</li>

        <li>Honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stack eight sheets of phyllo dough, brushing with melted butter between each layer, to create a sturdy base.</li>
        <li> Sprinkle it with a mixture of chopped nuts and cinnamon. Top with two sheets of phyllo dough and follow with the nut mixture.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process a few more times, until the nut mixture is gone. Top with about eight more layers of phyllo, buttering each layer.</li>
        <li>Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes. Be sure to cut all the way to the bottom of the pan. Bake until golden and crisp.</li>
