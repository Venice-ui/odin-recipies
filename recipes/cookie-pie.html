    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This delicious homemade pizookie is loaded with chocolate, nuts, and oats and baked in a cast iron skillet. As long as your skillet is well seasoned, the whole cookie will pop right out on a serving platter, making it perfect for a birthday cookie "cake." Slice in pie-shaped pieces and eat as-is, or serve with ice cream and chocolate sauce.</p>
